### Feedback & Updates üôá

After sharing my initial solution i got some feedback on areas i could improve. So below are some changes i made on the second commit.

#### HTML

- Changed the `.container` from `<div>` to a `<main>` so the document has a landmark element. [Resource](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.6/landmark-one-main?application=axeAPI)
- I initially had a `<h2>` and a `<h4>`. Changed those to `<h1>` and `<p>` respectively. [Resource](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.6/heading-order?application=axeAPI)
- Updated the `alt` text of the image to be more descriptive.

#### CSS

- Removed the fixed `width` of the container, and added a `max-width` so the container can be responsive in smaller screens while not getting too big on larger screens.
- Changed the `height` of the container to be `min-height`.
- Changed `img` element `width` to a `max-width` and set it to `display: block`
